Python Scripts

A number of Python scripts that I have completed through Udemy courses, edX MIT Python, Exercism, 
as well as other small scripts I have worked on. 

big_diff.py: This is a script that returns the largest difference between numbers in an array. 

binaryConverter.py: This script asks the user for a number input and then converts that number to an integer and then to a binary number.

blackjack.py: This is a game of blackjack I created. It still has some minor issues I need to fix and adjust to get it where I want, but it works for simply playing the game.

count_evens.py: This is a script that counts the number of even numbers in an array.

countString.py: A script that simply counts the number of words in a string.

countVowels.py: Prints the number of each vowel in a string as well as the total number of vowels.

countVowels2.py: This script just counts the number of each type of vowel in a string.

countVowels3.py: This counts the total number of vowels in a string.

factorial.py: A script that finds the factorial of a number through recursion. Also includes commented out code that doesn't use recursion.

fizzbuzz.py: A script that prints the numbers 1-100  (or whatever range is desired). For multiples of three, "Fizz" is printed, for multiples of five, "Buzz" is printed, and for multiples of three and five, "FizzBuzz" is printed.

longest_word.py: Returns the longest word in a sentence string.

multiples_3_5.py: Prints a list of all numbers that are multiples of three and five in a given range as well as the sum of the list.

palindrome.py: Determines whether or not a user entered string is a palindrome.

pigLatin.py: Changes a user given word into pig latin, for example banana becomes anana-bay.

randomPasswordGenerator.py: Generates a random password of 15 characters, made up of numbers, letters, and symbols.
