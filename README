Python Scripts

A number of Python scripts that I have completed through Udemy courses, edX MIT Python, Exercism, 
as well as other small projects I have worked on. 

big_diff.py: This is a script that returns the largest difference between numbers in an array. 

binaryconverter.py: This script asks the user for a number input and then converts that number to an integer and then to a binary number.
