Python Scripts

A number of Python scripts that I have completed through Udemy courses, edX MIT Python, Exercism, 
as well as other small projects I have worked on. 

big_diff.py: This is a script that returns the largest difference between numbers in an array. 

binaryConverter.py: This script asks the user for a number input and then converts that number to an integer and then to a binary number.

blackjack.py: This is a game of blackjack I created. It still has some minor issues I need to fix and adjust to get it where I want, but it works for simply playing the game.

count_evens.py: This is a script that counts the number of even numbers in an array.

countString.py: A script that simply counts the number of words in a string.

countVowels.py: Prints the number of each vowel in a string as well as the total number of vowels.

countVowels2: This script just counts the number of each type of vowel in a string.

countVowels3.py: This counts the total number of vowels in a string.
